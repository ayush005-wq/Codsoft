# 🏧 ATM Interface

Welcome to our simple yet powerful **ATM Interface** project! This application is implemented in Java and uses Swing for the graphical user interface. It's like having an ATM right on your computer!

## 💡 Features

- **💰 Check Balance**: Curious about how much money you have? Just click on the "Check Balance" button and a dialog box will appear showing your current balance.

- **💸 Withdraw Money**: Need cash? No problem! Click on the "Withdraw" button, enter the amount you want to withdraw in the dialog box that appears, and voila! The specified amount will be deducted from your balance.

- **💳 Deposit Money**: Got some extra cash you want to stash away safely? Click on the "Deposit" button, enter the amount you want to deposit in the dialog box that appears, and just like that, the specified amount will be added to your balance.

## 🚀 Usage

Using this application is as easy as 1-2-3. Simply run the `ATM.java` file. A window will appear with three buttons: "Check Balance", "Withdraw", and "Deposit". Click on these buttons to perform the corresponding actions.

## 🎨 Customization

Want to give your ATM Interface a personal touch? You can customize its look by modifying the `setBackground` and `setForeground` methods in the `ATM.java` file. These methods set the background color of the frame and buttons, and the text color of the buttons, respectively.
